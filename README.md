# QWorldParser

A parser for SRTM data (unfinished, but it works, if you can get it to compile).

## Description

The program can take SRTM data in hgt format and convert it to a height map. There are a few scripts to plot it using GnuPlot provided. Also some examples for inputs/outputs and finished plots can be found int the examples/ directory.

Sadly enough, I never finished this project, but maybe it helps someone.

Also I was not able to upload the git history to GitHub due to file size restrictions, but who cares ;)

## Requirements

- CMake
- Qt5
- Visual Studio >=2015
